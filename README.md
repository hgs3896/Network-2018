# Network-2018
This a github private repository for my network assignment.
It includes [some socket program](/src) that I've made and [some test program](/test/tc_generator.py) to test my program working properly.

## How to use my program?
 On the command line, just type "make".
 Then, the makefile utility starts to build the program.

 To start the server, execute [``server/server``](/src/server.c).

 To start the client to send a file to the server, execute [``client/client filepath``](/src/client.c).

 To test the program with simplicity, type ``"make test"``.
