# Network-2018
This a github private repository for my network assignment.
It includes some socket program that I've made and [some test cases](/testcases) to test my program working properly.

## How to use my program?
 On the command line, just type "make".
 Then, the makefile utility starts to build the program.

 To start the server, execute **server/server**.


 To start the client to send a file to the server, execute **client/client** filepath.


 To test the program with simplicity, type ``"make test"``.
